## A Note on Terminal Graphics
This tool makes use of the `â–€` block element character to draw in the terminal,
and setting ANSi codes for foreground and background colors as required. For 
best results your terminal should use a font as close to 2:1 height:width ratio 
as possible. The demo animation was recorded in Alacritty terminal with Iosevka.
